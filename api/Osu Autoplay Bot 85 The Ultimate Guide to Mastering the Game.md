However, some players are not satisfied with their skills or scores, and resort to using cheat tools to gain an unfair advantage. One of these cheat tools is called Osu Autoplay Bot 85, which is a program that automatically plays the game for the user, mimicking human-like movements and timing.
 
Osu Autoplay Bot 85 claims to be undetectable by the game's anti-cheat system, and to be able to play any song at any difficulty level. The program also allows the user to customize the settings, such as the cursor speed, the hit accuracy and the reaction time.
 
However, using Osu Autoplay Bot 85 is not only unethical, but also risky. The program may contain malware or viruses that can harm the user's computer or steal their personal information. Moreover, the game's developers are constantly updating their anti-cheat system, and may ban or suspend any account that is found to be using cheat tools.
 
Therefore, it is strongly advised that players do not use Osu Autoplay Bot 85 or any other cheat tool for Osu. Instead, they should practice and improve their skills legitimately, and enjoy the game as it is meant to be played.
