## What is RMO ATM?
  
RMO ATM stands for Rahul Mohindar Oscillator - Automated Trend Modules. It is a comprehensive trading system that consists of four main components:
  
- The RMO Indicator: This is the core of the system. It measures the strength of the trend and shows whether the market is bullish, bearish, or sideways.
- The Swing Trade Indicator: This is a set of arrows that indicate the optimal entry and exit points for swing trading. It works in sync with the RMO Indicator and filters out false signals.
- The Trend Decider Indicator: This is a line that acts as a dynamic support and resistance level. It helps traders to confirm the trend direction and avoid whipsaws.
- The Zone Detector Indicator: This is a histogram that shows the momentum of the market. It helps traders to identify high-probability trading zones and catch explosive moves.

Together, these indicators form a complete trading system that can be applied to any time frame, market, or instrument. RMO ATM can help traders to capture both short-term and long-term trends, as well as catch reversals and breakouts before they happen.
