Chhotu is forced to work as a helper at the dhaba, serving food and tea to the customers. He also has to deal with the bullying of Bhati's assistant, Lakha, who calls him a "dog". Chhotu is unhappy with his situation, but he does not lose hope. He is fascinated by books and newspapers, and tries to learn whatever he can from them.
 
One day, he sees a TV broadcast of the Republic Day parade, where he sees Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam, the former president of India, saluting the nation. He is inspired by his story of rising from humble origins to become a scientist and a leader. He decides to change his name to Kalam, and vows to follow his footsteps.
 
Soon after, he meets Ranvijay, the son of Raja Rudra Pratap Singh, who owns a palace-turned-hotel nearby. Ranvijay is lonely and bored, as he has no friends or freedom. He is also under pressure from his father to study hard and prepare for his future role as a king. He finds a friend in Kalam, who shares his curiosity and enthusiasm for learning. They sneak out of their respective places and spend time together, exploring the desert and the city.
 
Kalam also meets Lucy, a French tourist who stays at the hotel. She takes a liking to him and offers to teach him English and French. She also gives him books and clothes as gifts. Kalam is grateful for her kindness and friendship.
 
However, Kalam's life is not without challenges. He faces opposition from Bhati, who wants him to focus on work and not on education. He also faces trouble from Lakha, who accuses him of stealing books and clothes from Ranvijay. He also faces danger from Sukha Singh, a local goon who wants to kidnap Ranvijay for ransom.
 
Will Kalam be able to overcome these obstacles and achieve his dream of becoming like Dr. Kalam? Will he be able to help Ranvijay escape from his suffocating life and find his true calling? Will he be able to reunite with his mother and sister? Watch **I Am Kalam** to find out.
