## 5G Network Design with Forsk Atoll 2.8.0
 
5G networks are expected to deliver unprecedented levels of performance, reliability, and efficiency, as well as support new use cases and applications such as enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB), massive machine-type communications (mMTC), and ultra-reliable low-latency communications (URLLC)[^1^]. To achieve these goals, 5G networks will rely on new technologies such as massive MIMO, 3D beamforming, and mmWave propagation[^1^].
 
Forsk Atoll 2.8.0 provides operators with a flexible and evolutionary framework for the design and deployment of 5G networks. It supports the latest 5G NR radio technology modelling capabilities, including frequency range 1 (FR1) and frequency range 2 (FR2), flexible numerology and frame structure, dynamic spectrum sharing (DSS), carrier aggregation (CA), dual connectivity (DC), integrated access and backhaul (IAB), non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA), and more[^1^]. It also supports mmWave propagation modelling with ray tracing techniques, massive MIMO antenna modelling with 3D beamforming patterns, and site-specific antenna tilt optimisation[^1^].

With Forsk Atoll 2.8.0, operators can design and optimise their 5G networks in an integrated way with their existing 2G, 3G, and 4G networks. It features a multi-technology network database, a unified traffic model, a combined Monte Carlo simulator, and a multi-RAT ACP (Automatic Cell Planning) module[^3^]. Atoll can model the traffic-related aspects of multi-technology networks and dynamically spread traffic across network layers comprising macro, micro, small cells, and Wi-Fi hot spots[^1^]. It can also perform automatic site positioning (ASP) for greenfield deployments[^2^].
 
## 5G Network Optimisation with Forsk Atoll 2.8.0
 
Forsk Atoll 2.8.0 also enables operators to optimise their network settings for improving network coverage and capacity. It includes Automatic Frequency Planning (AFP) modules and Automatic Cell Planning (ACP) modules for various radio access technologies[^2^]. These modules enable radio network design engineers to automatically plan and allocate cell parameters such as frequencies, codes, powers, tilts, azimuths, etc., to minimise interference and maximise performance[^2^].
 
Forsk Atoll 2.8.0 also offers unique capabilities of using both predictions and live network data throughout the network planning and optimisation process. Live-network data (KPIs, UE/cell/MDT traces, and crowdsourced data) add real-world information to predictions allowing for enhanced modelling of traffic evolution, hot-spot identification, and radio signal propagation[^1^]. Live-network data can also be used in Atoll to drive the planning process (site selection) and to steer the optimisation algorithms of the AFP and the ACP[^1^].
 
## Conclusion
 
Forsk Atoll 2.8.0 is a powerful and comprehensive platform for designing and optimising multi-technology wireless networks, especially 5G networks. It supports the latest technology advances including massive MIMO, 3D beamforming, and mmWave propagation for the design and roll-out of 5G networks[^1^]. It also provides operators with a flexible and evolutionary framework for integrating their existing networks with their new 5G networks[^1^]. With Forsk Atoll 2.8.0, operators can streamline their
