## Tips and Tricks to Play Age Of Empires Gold Edition
 
Age Of Empires Gold Edition is not an easy game to master, especially if you are new to the real-time strategy genre. You will need to balance your economy, military, technology, and diplomacy to achieve victory. Here are some tips and tricks to help you play better and have more fun:

- Use hotkeys. Hotkeys are keyboard shortcuts that allow you to perform actions faster and more efficiently. You can use hotkeys to select buildings, units, commands, and menus. You can also customize your own hotkeys in the options menu. Learning and using hotkeys will give you an edge over your opponents[^2^].
- Scout your surroundings. Scouting is essential to gather information about your map, resources, enemies, and allies. You can use your villagers, military units, or ships to scout. Scouting will help you find the best spots for your base, plan your attacks and defenses, and avoid surprises[^3^].
- Build a diverse army. Age Of Empires Gold Edition has a rock-paper-scissors combat system, where some units are stronger or weaker against others. For example, spearmen are good against cavalry, cavalry are good against archers, and archers are good against infantry[^2^]. You should build a variety of units to counter your enemy's army and adapt to different situations[^2^].
- Capitalize on your civilization's strengths. Each civilization in Age Of Empires Gold Edition has its own unique bonuses, units, technologies, and weaknesses. You should play to your civilization's strengths and avoid its weaknesses. For example, if your civilization benefits from farms, build farms; if your civilization has strong cavalry, use cavalry; if your civilization lacks siege weapons, avoid fortified positions[^2^].
- Purchase upgrades. Upgrades are improvements that you can research at various buildings. They can enhance your units' combat abilities, your villagers' gathering speed, your buildings' defenses, and more. Upgrades can make a big difference in your performance and efficiency. You should prioritize the most useful upgrades for your strategy and situation[^2^].

These are just some of the tips and tricks that can help you play Age Of Empires Gold Edition better. There are many more strategies and tactics that you can discover and experiment with as you play. The most important thing is to have fun and enjoy this classic game!
