## Step 1: Download the keymaker tool
 
You can download the keymaker tool from various online sources, such as [Link 4share](https://link-4share.com/download/5J0X5bLiba/cisco_asa_5540_82_1_keymaker__.html), [Pastebin](https://pastebin.com/xmd06caa), [Docker](https://hub.docker.com/r/apabanrea/cisco-asa-5540-v8-2-1-keymaker-v1-0), or [Kit.co](https://kit.co/melraderee/cisco-asa-5505-keymaker-by-ssg-exe/cisco-asa-5505-keyma). The file name is Cisco ASA 5540 8.2(1) Keymaker v1.0 (Sep 2009) by SSG.exe and the file size is about 7.5 KB.
 
Make sure you scan the file with an antivirus program before running it, as it may contain malware or viruses.
 
## Step 2: Run the keymaker tool
 
After downloading the keymaker tool, run it on your computer. You will see a window like this:

The keymaker tool has four fields: Serial Number, Contexts, Failover, and VLANs. You need to fill in these fields according to your device specifications and desired features.
 
### Serial Number
 
The serial number is a unique identifier for your Cisco ASA 5540 device. You can find it by logging into your device and issuing the command `show version`. The serial number will be displayed in the output, like this:
 ![Show version output](https://i.imgur.com/6wRvzWd.png) 
Copy the serial number and paste it into the first field of the keymaker tool.
 
### Contexts
 
Contexts are virtual firewalls that allow you to partition your physical device into multiple logical devices, each with its own security policy and interfaces. The default number of contexts for Cisco ASA 5540 is two: one for system administration and one for user traffic. The maximum number of contexts for Cisco ASA 5540 with SecurityPlus license is 100.
 
You can choose how many contexts you want to enable on your device by entering a number between 2 and 100 in the second field of the keymaker tool.
 
### Failover
 
Failover is a feature that allows you to pair two identical Cisco ASA devices and configure them to provide redundancy and high availability. If one device fails, the other device takes over its functions without interrupting network traffic. The default failover mode for Cisco ASA 5540 is Active/Standby, which means one device is active and handles all traffic, while the other device is standby and ready to take over if needed. The alternative failover mode is Active/Active, which means both devices are active and share the traffic load.
 
You can choose whether you want to enable failover on your device by entering either
