But how can you get ESPRIT CAD CAM for free? Is there a way to download it without paying a hefty price? In this article, we will show you some options to get ESPRIT CAD CAM for free or at a low cost.
 
## Option 1: Use ESPRIT Learning Edition
 
One way to get ESPRIT CAD CAM for free is to use the ESPRIT Learning Edition. This is a free version of ESPRIT that you can download from the official website[^1^]. The ESPRIT Learning Edition is designed for demo and educational purposes, and it has some limitations compared to the full version. For example, it can only output 500 lines of G-code per program, it does not include post processors or machine simulation, and it expires after one year. However, it still allows you to access most of the features and functions of ESPRIT CAD CAM, such as:
 
- 2-5 axis milling
- 2-22 axis turning
- Multifunction lathes and mill-turn machines
- 2-5 axis wire-EDM
- Solid modeling and editing
- Knowledge-based machining
- Cloud-enabled collaboration

The ESPRIT Learning Edition is a great way to learn how to use ESPRIT CAD CAM and to test its capabilities before buying the full version. You can also use it for personal projects or hobby applications that do not require complex or large-scale machining.
 
## Option 2: Use ESPRIT Trial Version
 
Another way to get ESPRIT CAD CAM for free is to use the ESPRIT Trial Version. This is a 30-day trial version of ESPRIT that you can request from the official website[^1^]. The ESPRIT Trial Version is similar to the full version of ESPRIT, except that it has a time limit and it requires an internet connection. It includes all the features and functions of ESPRIT CAD CAM, such as:

- Factory-certified post processors for over 15,000 machines
- Machine-optimized G-code output
- Solid simulation and verification
- Automation solutions using API
- Seamless integration with popular CAD software like SOLIDWORKS[^2^], Autodesk Inventor[^3^], etc.
- Advanced support for complex machines and processes

The ESPRIT Trial Version is a good way to evaluate ESPRIT CAD CAM and to see how it can improve your CNC machining workflow. You can also use it for real projects or production applications that require high-quality and efficient machining.
 
## Option 3: Buy ESPRIT CAD CAM at a Discounted Price
 
If you want to get ESPRIT CAD CAM for a low cost, you can buy it at a discounted price from some online sources. For example, you can find some offers on websites like FileCR[^1^] or Mastercam[^4^] that sell ESPRIT CAD CAM at a fraction of its original price. However, you should be careful when buying from these sources, as they may not be authorized by DP Technology (the developer of ESPRIT) or they may not provide proper customer support or updates. You should also check the compatibility and functionality of the software before buying it, as it may not work with your machine or your CAD software.
