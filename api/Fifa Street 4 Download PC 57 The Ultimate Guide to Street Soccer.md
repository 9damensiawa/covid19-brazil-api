## How to Master FIFA Street 4 with Advanced Tricks
 
FIFA Street 4 is not just about playing soccer, it's also about showing off your style and flair. The game offers a variety of tricks that you can use to humiliate your opponents and score amazing goals. However, some of these tricks are not easy to pull off, and require practice and timing. In this article, we will show you some of the advanced tricks that you can learn to become a FIFA Street 4 master.
 
Before we start, you need to know how to perform the basic tricks in FIFA Street 4. To do this, you need to use the right analog stick (RAS) on your controller. The RAS allows you to control the ball with your feet, and perform different moves depending on the direction and speed of your flick. For example, flicking the RAS up will make you do a stepover, flicking it down will make you do a roulette, and flicking it left or right will make you do a feint. You can also combine different flicks to create more complex moves, such as a rainbow flick or a McGeady spin.

However, the RAS is not enough to perform the advanced tricks. You also need to use the left trigger (LT) and the left bumper (LB) on your controller. The LT allows you to modify your basic tricks and add more flair to them. For example, holding LT while flicking the RAS up will make you do a heel chop, holding LT while flicking the RAS down will make you do a Marseille turn, and holding LT while flicking the RAS left or right will make you do a flip flap. The LB allows you to perform aerial tricks and juggle the ball with different parts of your body. For example, tapping LB while holding the ball will make you flick it up in the air, tapping LB while moving will make you do a sombrero flick, and tapping LB while standing still will make you do a panna.
 
Now that you know how to use the RAS, LT, and LB, let's see some of the advanced tricks that you can do with them:

- **The Zidane Spin:** This trick is named after the legendary French player Zinedine Zidane, who used it to dribble past defenders with ease. To perform this trick, you need to hold LT and flick the RAS down twice in quick succession. This will make you do two consecutive roulettes in opposite directions, spinning around your opponent and leaving them behind.
- **The Elastico:** This trick is named after the Brazilian player Rivelino, who invented it in the 1970s. To perform this trick, you need to hold LT and flick the RAS right then left (or left then right) in quick succession. This will make you do a quick feint followed by a sharp change of direction, fooling your opponent and creating space for yourself.
- **The Hocus Pocus:** This trick is named after the Dutch player Clarence Seedorf, who popularized it in the 1990s. To perform this trick, you need to hold LT and flick the RAS down then up (or up then down) in quick succession. This will make you do a reverse stepover followed by a normal stepover, confusing your opponent and opening up a gap for yourself.
- **The Around The World:** This trick is one of the most difficult and impressive aerial tricks in FIFA Street 4. To perform this trick, you need to tap LB while holding the ball to flick it up in the air. Then, before it lands on your foot again, you need to rotate the RAS 360 degrees around either clockwise or counter-clockwise. This will make you circle your foot around the ball in mid-air, catching it again with style.
- **The Rabona:** This trick is one of the most stylish and flashy ways to shoot or pass the ball in FIFA Street 4. To perform this trick, you need to hold LT while pressing B (or circle) to shoot or A (or cross) to pass. This will make you cross your legs behind your standing leg and kick the ball with your back foot, surprising your opponent and scoring a spectacular goal.
