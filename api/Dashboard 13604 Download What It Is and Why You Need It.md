1. Extract the dashboard 1888 files to a folder of your choice using 7-Zip.
2. Extract xextool.exe to the same folder as the dashboard files.
3. Open a command prompt or PowerShell window and navigate to the folder where you extracted the files.
4. Run this command: `.\\xextool -d . xam.xex`. This will decrypt and decompress xam.xex, which is one of the main files of the dashboard.
5. Add the .xzp file extension to gamercrd, shrdres, and xam. These are compressed files that contain resources for the dashboard.
6. Run dash.xex in Xenia Canary. This will launch dashboard 1888.
7. Extract the dashboard 13604 update files using wxPirs, a tool that can open Xbox 360 system update packages. You can find wxPirs [here](https://digiex.net/threads/wxpirs-v1-1-xbox-360-xbox-1-downloadable-content-extractor.100/).
8. Copy all the extracted files to the same folder as the dashboard 1888 files, overwriting any existing files.
9. To run dashboard 13604, open $flash\_dash.xex in Xenia Canary. This is the main executable of the updated dashboard.

Congratulations! You have successfully downloaded and run Xbox 360 dashboard 13604 in Xenia Canary. You can now explore the features and settings of this version of the dashboard. However, keep in mind that some functions may not work properly or at all due to limitations of Xenia Canary or missing online services.
